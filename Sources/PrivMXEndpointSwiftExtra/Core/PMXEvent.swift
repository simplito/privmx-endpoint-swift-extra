	/// Processes the event by executing a specified callback.
	///
	/// This method allows for custom processing of event data, which is passed to the callback function. The `data` parameter contains information relevant to the event,
	/// though some events may lack associated data (hence, the optional `Any?` type).
	///
	/// - Parameter cb: A closure that processes the event's data. This callback accepts an optional `Any?` parameter representing the event's data.
	func handleWith(cb: @escaping @Sendable @MainActor (Any?) async -> Void)
	
	/// Provides a string that uniquely represents the type of the event.
	///
	/// This method should return a specific string that identifies the event type, enabling consistent event categorization and processing.
	///
	/// - Returns: A `String` representing the type of the event.
	static func typeStr() -> String
	
	/// Unique identifier for the connection associated with this event.
	///
	/// This property stores an `Int64` identifier that can be used to associate the event with a specific connection instance.
	var connectionId: Int64 { get }
	
	/// Retrieves the communication channel associated with this event.
	///
	/// This method provides the name or identifier of the channel related to the event, which can be useful for directing or filtering event handling based on channel context.
	///
	/// - Returns: A `String` representing the event's associated channel.
	func getChannel() -> String
	
	/// Retrieves the list of Subscribtion Ids of the Event

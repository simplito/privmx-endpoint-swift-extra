/// The `PrivMXConnection` protocol declares methods for managing connections to PrivMX Bridge with Swift types.
///
/// This protocol defines the required methods for setting up, managing, and disconnecting a connection to PrivMX platform.
/// It provides functionality for setting up the path to SSL certificates, managing connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect),
/// and retrieving important connection details such as the connection ID. Additionally, it offers methods for connecting with public or private access.
///
/// ## Key Features:
///
/// - **Certificate Management:** Supports setting the path to a `.pem` file containing the necessary SSL certificates for establishing a secure connection.
/// - **Connection Lifecycle:** Provides methods for connecting to and disconnecting from PrivMX Bridge.
/// - **Connection Identification:** Retrieves the unique connection ID for identifying the connection.
/// - **Context Access:** Lists the contexts to which the connected user has access.
///
/// ## Methods:
///
/// - `setCertsPath(_:)`: Sets the path to the `.pem` file containing the certificates needed for establishing the connection.
/// - `disconnect()`: Disconnects the current connection, releasing all resources associated with it.
/// - `connect(as:to:on:)`: Connects to PrivMX Bridge using the provided credentials (private key, solution ID, platform URL).
/// - `connectPublic(to:on:)`: Connects to PrivMX Bridge with public access, mainly used for public access to `InboxAPI`.
/// - `getConnectionId()`: Retrieves the unique connection ID for managing and identifying the current connection.
/// - `listContexts(basedOn:)`: Lists the contexts that the connected user has access to.
///
/// ## Usage:
///
/// This protocol is implemented by classes that establish and manage connections to PrivMX system, providing a common interface for interacting
/// with various aspects of PrivMX platform, including API access and connection management.
